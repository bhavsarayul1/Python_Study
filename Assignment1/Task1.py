# Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations

#input from user

number1 = float(input("Enter your first number: "))
number2 = float(input("Enter your sencond number: "))

# formula for mathematical operation

addition = number1 + number2
subtraction = number1 - number2
multiplication = number1 * number2
division = number1 / number2

#print result

print("Addition of both number is: ", addition)
print("Subtraction of both number is: ", subtraction)
print("Multiplication of both number is: ",multiplication)
print("Division of both number is: ", division)
